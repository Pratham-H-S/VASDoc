Answer for the Assignment:

1)   The execution of the Java program, the java.exe is called. The Java.exe inturn makes Java Native Interface or JNI calls, and they load the JVM. The java.exe parses the command line, generates a new String array, and invokes the main() method. A daemon thread is attached to the main method, and this thread gets destroyed only when the Java program stops execution.

2)  Here we'll use the boolean literal true to write the while loop condition:

public void infiniteLoopUsingWhile() {
    while (true) {
        // do something
    }
}

3)  While loop checks the condition first and then executes the statement(s), whereas do while loop will execute the statement(s) at least once, then the condition is checked.

4)  In the primitive types the sizes are known, so the code has been written in the compiler to give that size of memory to the variable in the stack.

5)  the keyword new is basically to allocated the memory. so when we asks the compiler to allocate some memory for some object .. it gives it depending upon the "size" of the object since the object size is unknown to compiler unless the program is running.

6)  We use arrayname. length to determine the number of rows in a 2D array

7)  syntax of method:public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}
example:
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
  }
}

8)  syntax :ClassName object = new ClassName();
public class CreateObjectExample1   
{    
void show()    
{    
System.out.println("Welcome to javaTpoint");    
}    
public static void main(String[] args)   
{    
//creating an object using new keyword   
CreateObjectExample1 obj = new CreateObjectExample1();   
//invoking method using the object  
obj.show();    
}    
}

9)  The String is immutable, so its value cannot be changed. If the String doesn't remain immutable, any hacker can cause a security issue in the application by changing the reference value. The String is safe for multithreading because of its immutableness. Different threads can access a single “String instance”.

10)  The stack frame holds the temporary, argument, and return address registers (if they need to be saved because of a subsequent function call), and any of the saved registers that the function will modify. It also holds local arrays and any excess local variables.

11)  All Strings are stored in the String Pool (or String Intern Pool) that is allocated in the Java heap.

12)  In static memory allocation whenever the program executes it fixes the size that the program is going to take, and it can’t be changed further.

13)  There are two ways to create a String object: By string literal : Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example: String s=“Welcome”; By new 
keyword : Java String is created by using a keyword “new”.

14)  Object-oriented programming has four basic concepts: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism. 

15)  There are major advantages to ArrayLists when real-world projects are concerned: ArrayLists can be appended dynamically: ArrayLists do not have to have a definite memory allocation like normal arrays when they are declared, they can be appended upon runtime. This saves unnecessary memory usage by the program.

16)  public class Sum {
  
    // Overloaded sum().
    // This sum takes two int parameters
    public int sum(int x, int y)
    {
        return (x + y);
    }
  
    // Overloaded sum().
    // This sum takes three int parameters
    public int sum(int x, int y, int z)
    {
        return (x + y + z);
    }
  
    // Overloaded sum().
    // This sum takes two double parameters
    public double sum(double x, double y)
    {
        return (x + y);
    }
  
    // Driver code
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Sum s = new Sum();
        System.out.println(s.sum(10, 20));
        System.out.println(s.sum(10, 20, 30));
        System.out.println(s.sum(10.5, 20.5));
    }
}

17)  The first command you will need to use is the SELECT FROM MySQL statement that has the following syntax: SELECT * FROM table_name;
